# YubiKeyPolicyBypass
The script checks if a YubiKey is connected, configuring its SSH key and adding it to the SSH agent. If not detected, it prompts for insertion and includes a bypass placeholder. It also removes Chrome policies from user-specific ($HOME/.config) and system-wide directories (/etc/opt/chrome).
